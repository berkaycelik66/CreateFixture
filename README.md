For the teams entered with Java, the match teams option should be written as a class.

**Rules:** 
- Double Term League method will be applied. Each team will have two matches being used at home and away.

- The left side of the list shows the home team and the right side shows the away team.

- If an odd number team list is entered, one more "Mr" team must be added to complete the even number. With Mr. means the teams won't be playing that week.
